                    Hello, My Name is Ahmad Syauqan Asqalani bin Azham and i from Kelantan. I have 12 siblings and I am the 11th child.
                    I have been interested in becoming a programmer as this is one of my skills from a young age. 
                    I really like IT and I want to be a very successful person in the future 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        One of the other reasons I chose to be a programmer because I was a poor physical member from the upper body
                        to the bottom but I never gave up on the dream I was about to achieve because I wanted to make people like 
                        that I was not sad and always had a great deal achieved success.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        "If success is to be achieved successfully, you should make a person inspiring in your life" 
                        This is a word that makes my heart flutter to pursue my ambition. 
                        I will not despair of what I dreamed of before.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I studied at the Kuala Langat Industrial Training Institute. I took the web application development 
                        software technology course for 5 years and 6 months with industrial training. I learned a lot in the college
                        such as HTML, CSS, Java, Design and more. You can contact me if you are interested in my partnership. thank you

                        A product strategy outlines a company's strategic vision for its product offerings by stating 
                        where the products are going, how they will get there and why they will succeed. The product 
                        strategy enables you to focus on a specific target market and feature set, instead of trying to 
                        be everything to everyone.

                        UI refers to the screens, buttons, toggles, icons, and other visual elements that you interact with 
                        when using a website, app, or other electronic device. UX refers to the entire interaction you have with 
                        a product, including how you feel about the interaction.

                        Mobile web design is the process of optimizing web experience for mobile users. This process includes creating:
                        Mobile-first design. Traditionally, websites have been optimized for desktop users, but as browsing habits have 
                        evolved, designers tend to follow a mobile-first approach in design
